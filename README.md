## 🧭 What We’re Covering

Over the next few weeks, we’ll explore:

### 🗄️ Databases
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database fundamentals
- **Mongoose** – Schema design and validation in Node.js

### 🧠 Backend Programming
- **Node.js** – Server-side JavaScript
- **Express.js** – Building RESTful APIs with middleware

### 🔐 Security & Authentication
- **User Auth** – Password hashing, tokens, sessions
- **Best Practices** – Environment variables, request validation

### 🧪 Testing & Debugging
- **Postman** – API testing and route validation
- **Error Handling** – Middleware and status codes

## 🧰 Projects & Progress

This repo will grow with:
- Backend service files
- MongoDB/Mongoose models and controllers
- Express route handlers
- API documentation and tests

## 📚 Weekly Overview

### Week 1–3: Node.js + Express + MongoDB
Build RESTful APIs using JavaScript/TypeScript, connect to MongoDB, and reinforce SQL knowledge by comparing database approaches. This sets the foundation for full-stack JavaScript development.

### Week 4: Generative AI Integrations
Integrate Large Language Models and image-generation APIs. Learn prompt engineering, embeddings, and basic agentic behaviors.

### Week 5–6: C# Fundamentals
Dive into C#—the final programming language of the course. Apply your TypeScript background to understand OOP, static typing, and modern .NET syntax.

### Week 7–8: ASP.NET Core APIs
Use C# and ASP.NET Core to build high-performance RESTful APIs with proper routing, middleware, and security.

### Week 9: SignalR + Real-Time Dashboards
Implement real-time features with SignalR. Push live updates to clients and explore event-driven backend architecture.

### Week 10: Testing in .NET
Write unit and integration tests using tools like xUnit and Moq. Learn how .NET testing frameworks work in professional environments.

### Week 11–12: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
Gain cloud literacy and prepare for the AZ-900 certification. Understand Azure’s core services, pricing, security models, and compliance fundamentals.
